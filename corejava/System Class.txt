=====================
public static native void arraycopy(Object src,  int  srcPos,
                                    Object dest, int destPos,
                                    int length)
----------------------------------------------------------------									
> Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the specified position, to the specified 
  position of the destination array
> The number of components copied is equal to the "length" argument
> So, the components at positions srcPos through srcPos+length-1 in the source array are copied into 
  positions destPos through destPos+length-1, respectively, of the destination array
> If dest is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown
> If src is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown and the destination array is not modified
> Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an ArrayStoreException is thrown and the destination is 
  not modified:

	-  The src argument refers to an object that is not an array
	-  The dest argument refers to an object that is not an array
	-  The src argument and dest argument refer to arrays whose component types are different primitive 
	   types
	-  The src argument refers to an array with a primitive component type and the dest argument refers 
	   to an array with a reference component type
	-  The src argument refers to an array with a reference component type and the dest argument refers 
	   to an array with a primitive component type
	- if any actual component of the source array from position srcPos through srcPos+length-1 cannot be 
	  converted to the component type of the destination array by assignment conversion
	  							
> Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown and the destination 
  is not modified:

	- The srcPos argument is negative
	- The destPos argument is negative
	- The length argument is negative
	- srcPos+length is greater than src.length, the length of the source array
	- destPos+length is greater than dest.length, the length of the destination array
